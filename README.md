index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the single-page application entry point.

style.css: All CSS styling for a modern, clean, and interactive UI.

main.js: The frontend JavaScript that handles all client-side logic, UI updates, and communication with the server.

package.json: Lists all required Node.js dependencies.

Deployment on Render
This application is configured for deployment on the Render platform.

Build Command: No build command is necessary as Render will automatically run npm install.

Start Command: node server.js

Setup Instructions (for Local Development)
Clone the Repository: Create a new folder on your machine and place all the files inside.

Install Dependencies: Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

npm install


Set Up Environment Variables: The server.js file expects two environment variables for the Giphy and Hugging Face APIs. Create a file named .env in the same directory as server.js and add your keys:

GIPHY_API_KEY="YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY"
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN"


Note: The code includes a fallback if these are not set, but the features will be simulated.

Run the Server: In your terminal, run the following command:

node server.js


Access the App: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
